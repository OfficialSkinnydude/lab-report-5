# Reflection
CSE 15L was an interesting class that taught me that I did not think I was going to learn or need. It was pretty cool how we were able to interact with the terminal and it was something that I had been wanting to learn because I was considering turning the Windows 10 PC into a linux machine. With this course, I am now comfortable enough to mess around with the terminal and have a good idea on how to access directories and execute them/open them. Sure, it taught me most of the basics, but once you learn the basics, you just keep digging and next thing you know, you are a pro! That being said, this lab has pushed me to idea of turning my PC into a linux system and experiment with computers more. Another area I would like to mention is learnign VIM. Now that was fun because I was terrified on what i was going to get into. I had seen many memes and how its hard and old, and I kind of agree, but it a cool experience and will try to solve a codwars challenge only using VIM.
